# Why is a joint analysis of degassing and deformation important for volcano monitoring?




## Because gases and deformation...

* bring quantitative insight into magma volumes, fluxes, and storage depth
* provide hints of the compressibility of the magma storage system
* carry crucial information about precursory signals preceding an impending eruption
