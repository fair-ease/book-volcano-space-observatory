# Estimating volcanic SO2 flux

To estimate SO2 flux released by volcanoes, we will use the "disk method", introduced in [Grandin et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JB029309).

The algorithm is available in open-source from ICARE's GitLab https://git.icare.univ-lille.fr/icare-public/so2-flux-calculator

The code can be installed using the following command:
```code
pip install 'so2-flux-calculator[test,interactive,ecmwfapi]' --index-url https://git.icare.univ-lille.fr/api/v4/projects/661/packages/pypi/simple
```

Below is a quick introduction of the principle of the method

### Idealized model of a SO2 plume

The method starts with a simplified model describing the distribution of column amount released by a point source:

$$D(x,y) = \int C(x,y,z)\; \mathrm{d}z = \dfrac{\dot{m}/u}{\sqrt{4 \pi D_y (x/u)}}.\exp{\left\{ \dfrac{-uy^2}{4 D_y x} \right\}}.\exp{\left\{ \dfrac{-kx}{u}\right\}}
$$ (eq:idealized_plume)

where:
* $C$ : SO2 concentration (local)
* $D$ : SO2 column amount (integrated in the vertical direction)
* $x, y$ : cartesian coordinates
* $u$ : wind speed
* $\dot{m}$ : SO2 mass flux from the source
* $k$ : (inverse) decay rate due to SO2 degradation
* $D_x, D_y$ : diffusion coefficients

This expression is a simplified solution of the advection-diffusion equation, commonly named a "gaussian plume".

### Mass versus distance

Integrating Equation {eq}`eq:idealized_plume` as a function of distance $r$ from the source gives the following integrated-mass-to-distance expression:

$$M_{volc}(r)= \iint_{R=0}^{R=r} D(R)\mathrm{d}S \approx \int_{x=0}^{x=r} \int_{y=-\infty}^{y=+\infty}D(x,y) \:\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y = \dfrac{\dot{m}}{k} \left( 1 - \exp{\left\{ \dfrac{- k r}{u}\right\}} \right)$$ (eq:mass_to_distance)

A first-order expansion of Equation {eq}`eq:mass_to_distance` yields a simplified result: 

$$M_{volc}(r)\approx\dfrac{\dot{m}}{u}r$$ (eq:mass_to_distance_linear)

This expression states that integrated mass $M$ is proportional to distance $r$ from the source. The proportionality factor, $\dot{m}/u$ is a quantity named the "proto-flux", which is defined as the ratio of the SO2 mass flux ($\dot{m}$) and wind velocity ($u
$).

### The importance of noise

This idealized model is perturbed by two additional factors that cannot be avoided when working with real data:

* data is noisy
* users typically mask out pixels with "low" SO2 concentrations, which are considered as meaningless (a process called "truncation")


```{image} content/idealized_versus_noisy_data.jpg
:alt: idealized_versus_noisy_data
:align: center
```

This situation can be modeled using a truncated gaussian probability function, which introduces a quadratic term in Equation {eq}`eq:mass_to_distance_linear`:

$$M(r) &=& M_{volc}(r)& + &M_{noise}(r)\\
&=& \dfrac{\dot{m}}{u}r &+& b.r^2$$


Therefore, the estimation procedure consists in performing a regression, where :
* the linear factor is the volcanic "proto-flux"
* the quadratic term is the "noise".

### Recap: main steps of the method

* estimate $\dot{m}/u$ from TROPOMI data, along with the noise term, by regression
* multiply the "proto-flux" by wind speed $u$
* the final result if the SO2 mass flux $\dot{m}$


### Key simplifications

* fixed source
* constant wind
* constant mass flux
* along-plume diffusion is neglected compared to plume transport (Low PÃ©clet number)
* truncated gaussian noise model
* separability of the linear and quadratic terms of the regression
