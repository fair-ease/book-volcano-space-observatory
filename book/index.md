The Volcano Space Observatory is a pilot developed as part of the FAIR-EASE project (WP5 "Earth and Environment Dynamics"). 

By combining satellite and ground-based data, it provides near real-time insights into volcanic emissions of gas and particles as well as volcano ground deformation and topographic changes to track changes in the state of activity of any active volcano worldwide.
